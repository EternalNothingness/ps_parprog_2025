	\section{Mandelbrot}
	The execution time of the program mandelbrot is measured.
	\subsection{Source Code}
	\inputminted{c}{mandelbrot/mandelbrot.c}
	\subsection{Measurement Method}
	The measurement was done on the LCC3 cluster by calling sbatch job.sh. The following scripts are involved in the measurement process.
	\subsubsection{SLURM Job Script}
	\inputminted{bash}{mandelbrot/job.sh}
	\subsubsection{Main Script}
	\inputminted{bash}{mandelbrot/main.sh}
	
	The measurement results are stored in mandelbrot\_measurments.log, which is read by process\_results to compute the average execution time and standard deviation, which are stored in mandelbrot\_processed.log.
	
	\subsection{Measurement Results}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline \#threads & time/s & mean/s & standard deviation/s\\
